#**1. The framework used for the project construction
and the management of dependencies.**


##**Date:** 2024-07-02

##**Status:** Accepted

##**Context:**
##We need assistance with the web project creation as well as the management of dependencies.
##The solution should be integrated with Java 17 and compatible with IntelliJ IDEA.

##**Solutions:**
###* Option 1: Gradle
###* Option 2: Maven

##**Decision**
##Both frameworks are widely accepted and applied,
##designed by active communities, and they provide similar efficiency.
##Taking into consideration the teamâ€™s experience with Apache Maven,
##it is exactly this framework that is going to be easier to apply.

##**Consequences:**
## The 100 Ideas project applies Apache Maven in order to build and manage dependencies.

#**2. Java Framework**


##**Date:** 2024-07-02

##**Status:** Accepted

##**Context:**
##We need to select a web framework in order to accelerate the speed
##the development of the 100 Ideas project.
##The framework should be as available and popular as possible,
##so that its application would make it easier to find a job 
as a Junior Java Developer.

##**Solutions**
###* Option 1: Spring Framework
###* Option 2: Jakarta EE

##**Decision**
##Both frameworks satisfy the requirements of the project.
##However, the Spring framework is much more popular in Poland,
##so that there are more opportunities on the job market. 

##**Consequences**
The Spring and Spring Boot frameworks are going to be applied
as the main frameworks for the 100 Ideas project.

##* CI/CD - Jenkins, Bamboo, GitHub Actions etc.
##* Databases - MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle Database etc.
