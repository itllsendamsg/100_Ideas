# **1. The framework used for the project construction**
# **and the management of dependencies.**
***

**Date:** 2024-07-02

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
We need assistance with the web project creation as well as the management of dependencies.

The solution should be integrated with Java 17 and compatible with IntelliJ IDEA.

**Solutions:**
* Option 1: Gradle
* Option 2: Maven

**Decision:**
Both frameworks are widely accepted and applied,

designed by active communities, and they provide similar efficiency.

Taking into consideration the teamâ€™s experience with Apache Maven,

it is exactly this framework that is going to be easier to apply.

**Consequences:**
The 100 Ideas project applies Apache Maven in order to build and manage dependencies.

# **2. Java Framework**
***

**Date:** 2024-07-02

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:**
We need to select a web framework in order

to accelerate the speed of the development

of the 100 Ideas project.

The framework should be as available and popular as possible,

so that its application would make it easier to find a job

as a Junior Java Developer.


**Solutions**

* Option 1: Spring Framework
* Option 2: Jakarta EE

**Decision**

Both frameworks satisfy the requirements of the project.

However, the Spring framework is much more popular in Poland,

so that there are more opportunities on the job market. 

**Consequences**

The Spring and Spring Boot frameworks are going to be applied

as the main frameworks for the 100 Ideas project.
